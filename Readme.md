# Update and Export variations of Lens Cap Holder for 3d printing

This is a Python script to interface with Fusion 360's API for updating the CAD model of the Lens Cap holder.
It will prompt the user to provide a minimum and a maximum lens diameter, and the width of the camera strap.
Then, the script will create versions of the lens cap holder in 1 mm increments between the minimum and the maximum diameter, for the strap width indicated by the user. It will save all the variations as STL files in a directory indicated by the user.

If you'd like to learn more about this, I wrote an article about how the script works.

If you are interested in the Lens Cap holder itself, you can [donwload the files created with this parametric model](https://www.printables.com/model/129882-lens-cap-holder-for-camera-strap/comments) so that you cna 3D print them yourself, or [buy physical prints of the Lens Cap holder](https://vulkaza.com/collections/twothingies)
