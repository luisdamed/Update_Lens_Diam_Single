# Update and Export variations of Lens Cap Holder for 3d printing

This is a Python script to interface with Fusion 360's API for updating the CAD model of the Lens Cap holder.
It will prompt the user to provide a minimum and a maximum lens diameter, and the width of the camera strap.
Then, the script will create versions of the lens cap holder in 1 mm increments between the minimum and the maximum diameter, for the strap width indicated by the user. It will save all the variations as STL files in a directory indicated by the user.

If you'd like to learn more about this, [I wrote an article about how the script works](https://www.makerluis.com/the-power-of-python-and-fusion-360-for-3d-printing/).
